# Send Data from Matlab and receive by Python
It's a simple Server-Client project. Matlab acts as the server and Python acts as a client. This a simple template for sending sensory data for IOTsdata

1- Be sure that both client and server are in the same network (e.g they share 192.168.1.1)
2- Changing data length needs more attention. So, be sure what Python data type send/recieve.
